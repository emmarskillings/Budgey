#BUDGEY - Lighthouse Labs Final Project

**Creators: Zohaib Hassan, Eric Joo, Emma Skillings, Eliza Moore**

## Overview

Budgey is a dynamic and intuitive budgeting app for those looking for a way to easily manage and visualize their personal finances. Budgey allows users to customize different income and expense categories each with their own entries. Expense categories include budget goals and progress bars to show how close you are to your spending limits! A donut chart and number summary on the main dashboard give users an at-a-glance overview of their spending and budget projections.
